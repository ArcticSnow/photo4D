## Objectives

 1. Obtain 2D snow cover extent map
 2. Derive 3D maps for pairs of time-lpase pictures
 3. improve design (targets, camera set up and settings, image preprocessing, number of camera...)
 4. Assess accuracy, precision: compare to lidar, dGPS snow-deph measurements. What paramters have the largest influence on the results
 5. try automating every steps of the algorithm, and combine scripts into one program (app)
 6. Success??!

## Description

This project will consist to develop an automated program to derive 4 dimentional (x,y,z,t) description of the snow surface within the field of view of several time-lapse camera.

The project should be based on open-source libraries, for public release. 

## Strategy

1. open RAW on Python and split image between snow area and other using threshold
2. expose using histogram equalizer both masked selection
3. recombine image to run through Micmac

4. run micmac script using different parameter (number of pics, position of camera, exposition
5. estimate model error against (lidar?). Test Micmac method on a scene with no snow
